# 🎨 Lancer

A soon to be modern, OpenGL-powered canvas — built for freelancers, real-time tools, and smooth drawing.

> Built with Qt + QOpenGL, hand-coded geometry, and more features to come.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Pressure simulated strokes with triangle strip rendering
- Real OpenGL performance
- Custom brush pipeline
- VBO-backed rendering for stability and speed
- Newly implemented undo, redo buttons

---

## 🧑‍💻 Building It Yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WolfSecV1/Lancer.git
cd Lancer
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./Lancer
```

Or simply run the batchfile if you are running windows. (Qt 6.9.1 is required to build.)
